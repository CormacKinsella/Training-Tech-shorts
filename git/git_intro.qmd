## Git branches
Once you have cloned a specific git repository locally on your computer, you can navigate and/or create new branches on it using git CLI. Here some examples:
- To create a branch and switch to it type `git checkout -b branch_name` 
- To push the newly created branch to the remote repository type `git push -u origin branch_name` 
- To display all branches on the local and remote repository type `git branch -a` 
- To switch to one of the displayed branches type `git ckeckout name_of_branch`. **Once a change is committed to that branch, pushing the committed change will be pushed to that specific branch on the remote repository.**
- To delete a branch type `git branch -d name_of_branch_to_delete`
