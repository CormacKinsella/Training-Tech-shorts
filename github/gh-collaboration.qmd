# How to collaborate on Github

## Making a branch

## Making changes

- Fork the whole target repository to your own account, by selecting "Fork" -> include all the branches (i.e., untick "Copy the main branch only") -> "Create fork".
- On your fork, first go into the correct branch for making edits by clicking the branch drop down menu and selecting it.
- To edit a file that already exists, navigate to it then click the pencil symbol to go into edit mode. 
- If instead you need to make a new file in the branch, click the "Add file" drop down -> "create new file". Give the file a meaningful name and extension. When naming files you can make new directories by adding forward slashes in the title, e.g., "github/myfile.qmd" will create the folder github also.
- Add the file contents in edit mode.
- When finished, click "Commit changes..."

## Making a draft pull request

## Making a ready for review pull request

-After commiting the changes to the file, the user creates a draft pull request by clicking in pull requests tab->create a pull request ->clicking in the dropdown next to create pull request and clicking in create draft pull request. 
-On the right side panel, you should invite a reviewer that has been assigned to your caption. 
-The reviewer will go through the changes that you made on the original file and suggest changes, for example, clicking on the '+' icon. 

## Code review

## Making changes

## Merging

- Once the changes are approved by the reviewer(s), and there are no conflicts of your branch with the base branch, you can merge the changes you've made on your branch into the main branch of the target repository.
- To do that, you click on "Pull requests" in the header line of the target repository, and select your pull request. Here you click on "Merge pull request" to perform the merging.
- A github workflow is planned that will automatically publish the updated text on the website.
