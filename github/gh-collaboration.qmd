# How to collaborate on Github

## Making a branch

## Making changes

- Fork the whole target repository to your own account, by selecting "Fork" -> include all the branches (i.e., untick "Copy the main branch only") -> "Create fork".
- On your fork, first go into the correct branch for making edits by clicking the branch drop down menu and selecting it.
- To edit a file that already exists, navigate to it then click the pencil symbol to go into edit mode. 
- If instead you need to make a new file in the branch, click the "Add file" drop down -> "create new file". Give the file a meaningful name and extension. When naming files you can make new directories by adding forward slashes in the title, e.g., "github/myfile.qmd" will create the folder github also.
- Add the file contents in edit mode.
- When finished, click "Commit changes..."

## Making a draft pull request

After making and committing changes as described above, navigate to the Pull requests tab. Click "New pull request" which will produce a "Comparing changes" page with four dropdown lists. The leftmost two dropdown lists refer to the target repository of the pull request and should be set to NBISweden/Training-Tech-shorts, followed by the target branch. The two rightmost dropdown lists refer to the pull request source and should point to your repository and, importantly, the branch that you are editing (and make sure it matches the target branch!). Once done, click "Create pull request" which will generate a pull request page where you can make comments on your PR. Finally, change the green dropdown button "Create pull request" to "Create draft pull request" and you're done!

## Making a ready for review pull request

After commiting the changes to the file, the user creates a draft pull request by clicking in pull requests tab, create a pull request, clicking in the dropdown next to create pull request and clicking in create draft pull request. On the right side panel, you should invite a reviewer that has been assigned to your caption. The reviewer will go through the changes that you made on the original file and suggest changes, for example, clicking on the '+' icon.
