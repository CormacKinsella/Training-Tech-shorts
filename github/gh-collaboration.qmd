# How to collaborate on Github

## Making a branch

## Making changes

- Fork the whole target repository to your own account, by selecting "Fork" -> include all the branches (i.e., untick "Copy the main branch only") -> "Create fork".
- On your fork, first go into the correct branch for making edits by clicking the branch drop down menu and selecting it.
- To edit a file that already exists, navigate to it then click the pencil symbol to go into edit mode. 
- If instead you need to make a new file in the branch, click the "Add file" drop down -> "create new file". Give the file a meaningful name and extension. When naming files you can make new directories by adding forward slashes in the title, e.g., "github/myfile.qmd" will create the folder github also.
- Add the file contents in edit mode.
- When finished, click "Commit changes..."

## Making a ready for review pull request

-On the right side panel, you should invite a reviewer that has been assigned to your caption. 
-The reviewer will go through the changes that you made on the original file and suggest changes, for example, clicking on the '+' icon.
