# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a series of short lessons in various technologies useful to our work.

## Quick start

The first step is to read over the lesson Github Collaboration.

1. Make a branch for your lesson.
2. Create a Quarto markdown document with `## Objectives` and `## Key points` and add it to that branch.
3. Add the document to the `_quarto.yml`.
4. Teach your topic to your team for 30-45 mins.
5. Each learner selects a key point to contribute material on. Make an issue for that topic and assign 
yourself and another learner to review your contribution.
6. Make a draft pull request to the lesson branch and ask the other learner assigned to review. Make changes until you're both happy. 
7. Mark the pull request as ready, and request the instructor to review.
8. The instructor reviews and merges the lesson branch when all contributions have been received.
