# Introduction to Git

## What is git

## What should git be used for

## Git Repositories

- A git repository (repo) is any folder structure that is version-controlled by git.
- A git repo can be initialized from a local folder, or cloned from a remote repo.
  - To initialize a repo from a local folder:
```bash
cd myfolder
git init
```
  - To clone a git repo from a remote source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/repo
```
- Regardless of how you obtain it, your local copy of the git repo will contain a `.git` folder. That is where the change history of your project is stored and maintained by git.

## Git branches

## File staging and git commit

Staging in Git involves adding new, modified, or deleted files to a staging area before committing them. This allows for flexibility in choosing the files to commit.

1. Check status via `git status` You'll see what branch you are on (which for new repos will be master) and status of files (untracked, modified, or deleted).  
2. Stage Files to Prepare for Commit
 - Stage all files: `git add .`
 - Stage a file: `git add example.html`
 - Stage a folder: `git add myfolder`
3. Check status again: `git status` You should see there are changes ready to be committed.
4. Unstage a File
  - If you accidental stage something, use the following command to unstage it: `git reset HEAD example.html`
5. Deleting Files
  - If you delete files they will appear in git status as deleted, and you must use git add to stage them. Another way to do this is using git rm command, which both deletes a file and stages it all with one command:
  - `git rm example.html` to remove a file (and stage it)
  - `git rm -r myfolder` to remove a folder (and stage it)
6. Commit Files 
  -  `git commit -m "Message that describes what this change does"`
7. Check status again: `git status` If all changes have been committed, and there are no untracked files, it should say: nothing to commit, working tree clean. 
8. View a List of Commits
  - When viewing a list of commits, there are various commands depending on how much info you want to see.
  - To see a simplified list of commits, run this command: `git log --oneline`
  - To see a list of commits with more detail (such who made the commit and when), run this command: `git log` NOTE: If the list is long, use the Down/Up Arrow keys to scroll and hit Q to quit.
  - To see a list of commits with even more detail (including which files changed), run this command: `git log --stat`

## Git push/pull

## Git merge and git rebase
