# Introduction to Quarto

## What is Quarto (Tomas / André)

### The Quarto CLI

0. In order to use quarto you need to install quarto first. The easiest way is to get the package for your desired platform directly from [https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/). If you need the most recent version you can also get the source code from the [quarto-cli](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli) git repository.
