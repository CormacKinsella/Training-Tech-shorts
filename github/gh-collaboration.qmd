# How to collaborate on Github

## Making a branch
- On the main page of the repository go to the file tree view on the left and click on the branch dropdown menu.
- Click on view all branches
- Click New branch, give it a name and select the branch source.
- Finally, click create branch

You also have the possibility to directly make a branch by clicking on the drop-down menu and give a unique name in the "Find or create branch..." field, followed by clicking Create branch. 
This will give the exact same result as the steps above.

This short description might be confusing since there are more than one way of doing this.
A step-by-step guide with pictures is available here (https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository)

## Making changes

- Fork the whole target repository to your own account, by selecting "Fork" -> include all the branches (i.e., untick "Copy the main branch only") -> "Create fork".
- On your fork, first go into the correct branch for making edits by clicking the branch drop down menu and selecting it.
- To edit a file that already exists, navigate to it then click the pencil symbol to go into edit mode. 
- If instead you need to make a new file in the branch, click the "Add file" drop down -> "create new file". Give the file a meaningful name and extension. When naming files you can make new directories by adding forward slashes in the title, e.g., "github/myfile.qmd" will create the folder github also.
- Add the file contents in edit mode.
- When finished, click "Commit changes..."

## Making a draft pull request

## Making a ready for review pull request

-After commiting the changes to the file, the user creates a draft pull request by clicking in pull requests tab->create a pull request ->clicking in the dropdown next to create pull request and clicking in create draft pull request. 
-On the right side panel, you should invite a reviewer that has been assigned to your caption. 
-The reviewer will go through the changes that you made on the original file and suggest changes, for example, clicking on the '+' icon.
