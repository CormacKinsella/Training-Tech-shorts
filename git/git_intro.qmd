## Git Repositories

- A git repository (repo) is any folder structure that is version-controlled by git.
- A git repo can be initialized from a local folder, or cloned from a remote repo.
  - To initialize a repo from a local folder:
```bash
cd myfolder
git init
```
  - To clone a git repo from a remote source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/repo
```
- Regardless of how you obtain it, your local copy of the git repo will contain a `.git` folder. That is where the change history of your project is stored and maintained by git.
